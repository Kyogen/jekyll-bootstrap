# About myself

I mainly deal in all things Linux: programming in C and Bash (and a little bit
C++). My Linux distribution of choice is
[Archlinux][arch]. It's rolling release and very
customizable. Give it a try!  With this blog I want to share some of my
experiences in computing. I'm in no way an expert, but I considered blogs like
this always to be very helpful.
